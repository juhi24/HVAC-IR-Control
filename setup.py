    # syntax, for example:
    #
    #   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]

    # Similar to `install_requires` above, these must be valid existing
    # projects.

    # installed, specify them here.
    package_data={
        #'hvacir': ['data/*.db', 'data/img/*.jpg'],

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
    #
    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'
    #data_files=[('my_data', ['data/data_file'])],  # Optional

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    #entry_points={  # Optional
    #    'console_scripts': [
    #        'sample=sample:main',
    #    ],
    #},
